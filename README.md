Please goto nodejs.org to download the node js onto your computer. Then with either cmd prompt or vscode terminal, set your directory to where you have the project.
After directory is set, type 'node server' into the prompt or terminal. This command opens server.js via node js. 
Thanks for having a look, any questions and/or suggestions hit me either on here or email => hatupistudio@gmail.com
